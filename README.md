# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a bootcamp student, I needed a tool to help me study topics I learned during the bootcamp prework. I built a webpage to act as a study guide that I can easily access on multiple devices. This helps me solve the issue of learning an large amount of information by keeping it all in one place. I learned HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript

Each section contains notes about certain topics, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics I learned from prework and choose one topic for you to study first.
