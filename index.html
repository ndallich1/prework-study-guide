          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the basic building block of a website</li>
          <li>HTML is one of the (3) core languages of the web</li>
          <li>HTML handles the context of a website and the structure or meaning of each element on a page</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible context shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The link element conneccts an external resource to the HYML document</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for the website</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>the title of a webpagecan be seen in the page's tab or browser title bar</li>
          <li>Child elements are elements nested inside other elements</li>
          <li>Parent element is an element that holds all child elements</li>
          <li>Charset: sets our character encoding</li>
          <li>http-equiv: sets an HTTP header for content</li>
          <li>viewport: sets the default view for our webpage</li>
          <li>Tags: what is inside angle brackets (<>)</li>
          <li>h1, h2, h3, etc.: heading levels. h1 should only appear on a page once!</li>
          <li>p: paragraph</li>
          <li>ul: unordered list</li>
          <li>ol: ordered list</li>
          <li>li: list items (like a bullet point)</li>
          <li>src: defines location of an image</li>
          <li>br: line break</li>
          <li>a: creates a link to the same webpage or other webpages (anchor)</li>
          <li>href: points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>alt: contains text string that describes the appearance and funtionality of the image</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS defines the colors, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only. This is good for quick changes, but less flexible than internal and external style sheets.</li>
          <li>Internal Style Sheet: embed an entire style sheet directly in the HTML using a style element in the head element.</li>
          <li>External Style Sheet: all CSS rules are kepy in a separate file. This makes design changes easier. External Style Sheets are most common.</li>
          <li>Declarations: contain the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>Selector: an element that CSS will apply</li>
          <li>(DRY) code: DO NOT REPEAT YOURSELF</li>
          <li>rel: specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked resource document</li> 
          <li>href: specifies the location (URL) of the external resource</li>
          <li>Class Attributes: allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>

          <li>git add -A: adds modifications to the staging area. -A flag indicates we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit</li>
